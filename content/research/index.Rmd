I'm interested in high performance buildings that enhance occupant comfort and well-being. This includes indoor environmental quality, application of sensor technologies to built environments, psychophysics, and human thermal physiology & comfort. Below is an overview of some of the research I've done over the last 10 years.

# Occupant surveys

I'm responsible for the <a href="https://cbe.berkeley.edu/resources/occupant-survey/" target="_blank">CBE Occupant Survey</a>, one of the largest and longest-running post-occupancy evaluation tools. This includes analysing the database of 90,000 responses from over 800 office buildings. I've published work <a href="https://doi.org/10.5334/bc.76" target="_blank">summarising the survey</a> and exploring the source of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108270" target="_blank">occupant dissatisfaction</a>.

```{r survey, include = TRUE, fig.height = 4}

# load plot object
read_rds(here::here("static", "plots", "plot_sat.rds")) +
  theme(plot.background = element_blank())

```

Much of my time on this project involves working closely with industry partners to evaluate their office buildings. Some of these organisations include International WELL Building Institute, Salesforce, JLL, Atelier Ten, Gensler, and Arup.

# Wildfire resilience

Fine particulate matter is the largest environmental risk factor for human health and death in California, and wildfires in the western United States are a major source. With this <a href="https://citris-uc.org/13-cross-campus-projects-selected-for-2021-seed-awards/" target="_blank">project</a> we developed a technological intervention to help mitigate the health impacts of wildfire smoke in Californian homes. The solution includes software for smart thermostats to adjust ventilation system operation based on outdoor particulate concentrations. This ensures adequate indoor air quality and improves public health and climate resilience in residential buildings.

```{r citris, include = TRUE, fig.height = 5.5}

# load plot object
read_rds(here::here("static", "plots", "plot_map.rds")) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma", direction = -1, limits = c(5, 55), 
                       breaks = c(10, 30, 50), labels = c("10", "30", "50\nÂµg/m3")) +
  labs(fill = "Indoor PM2.5") +
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 0.5, barheight = 6)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_blank(), 
        plot.subtitle = element_blank(), 
        legend.title.align = 0.0,
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.position = c(0.8, 0.77),
        plot.background = element_blank())

```

A major aim of the project is to evaluate the filtration efficiency of portable air cleaners compared to central furnace systems. We developed a dynamic mass balance model of particulate infiltration to simulate indoor particulate exposure during the 2020 wildfires based on housing characteristics from census data at the tract level.

# Overcooling

The appetite for cooling is growing - air conditioning represents the fastest growing source of energy use in buildings, with cooling energy tripling between 1990 and 2016. Part of this energy demand is wasted on excessive cooling of offices. <a href="https://rdcu.be/cCQlN" target="_blank">We analyzed</a> 38,851 satisfaction responses in the CBE Occupant Survey as well as crowd-sourced thermal comfort feedback from office building occupants on Twitter. We collected 16,791 tweets with common expressions of cold discomfort across the US and found office temperatures are generally less comfortable for women largely due to this overcooling.

The impacts of this pervasive overcooling on well-being and performance are borne predominantly by women. These findings corroborate existing evidence of lower thermal satisfaction in offices for women and identify overcooling as a common reason for the gender disparity. The problem is likely to increase in the future due to growing demand for cooling in increasingly extreme climates.
