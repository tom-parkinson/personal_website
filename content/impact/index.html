<p>My research goal is to improve built environments for the people who inhabit them. Part of this desire is for my work to have impact on both the research community and practitioners in the building sector. While it is difficult to assess the impact on practice, research metrics provide an overview of the interest in my work. This is a summary of that impact using data from Scopus.</p>
<p>In the 8 years that I have been active, I have published 23 articles and 8 conference papers. All 23 journal papers are in Q1 journals based on the SJR system. Research outlets include high-impact journals like Building and Environment, Energy and Buildings, Building Research and Information, and Nature Scientific Reports. The plot below shows my research outputs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index" target="_blank">h-index</a> each year since my first publication.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>My h-index of 15 demonstrates a continued commitment to publishing research with impact. This is reinforced by my work being cited a total of 956 times as per Scopus. I have over 1,200 citations on ResearchGate and over 1,500 on Google Scholar as of July, 2022. The plot below showing the number of citations per year indicates an upward trend. I am ranked 31st of Australian researchers in Built Environment and Design based on field-weighted citation impact.</p>

<p>I have a track-record of publishing papers in high-impact outlets that attract interest from the research community. The plot below shows the impact of my publications compared to the impact factors of the journal in which they are published. The majority of papers published before 2020 have above-average citations, and the most successful publications attracting over 5 times the average number for those journals. Points with white text indicated works that were published within the last two years.</p>

<p>My work has been cited by researchers from 77 countries, with most interest coming from China, USA, Australia, and UK.
This reflects my commitment to exploring ideas that are global in scope and relevant to an international audience. I am fortunate enough to have worked with a number of peers and mentors from around the world, with 55% of my outputs from international collaborations. The map below shows my network of co-authors from 45 in 21 countries.</p>
